# Naboom Community Platform Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Community-First Development

Every feature MUST prioritize community safety and accessibility for South African users. All development decisions must consider the impact on neighborhood security, emergency response capabilities, and user accessibility across diverse South African communities. Features that enhance community safety take absolute priority over convenience features.

### II. Vue 3 + DaisyUI Consistency

All components MUST use Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4 and DaisyUI 5 with existing theme patterns (Light/Business themes). No custom CSS frameworks or component libraries are permitted. All UI elements must follow DaisyUI semantic class naming and maintain consistency with the established Community Security theme palette.

### III. HTTP3 Optimization

Features MUST leverage existing HTTP3 QUIC protocol infrastructure for optimal performance on South African networks. All API calls, real-time communications, and emergency response features must be designed to work efficiently over HTTP3 connections with proper fallback mechanisms for unstable network conditions.

### IV. Multilingual Support

All features MUST support English and Afrikaans using Vue I18n from day one. No feature can be considered complete without full localization support. All user-facing text, error messages, and system notifications must be available in both languages with proper RTL support where applicable.

### V. Mobile-First Emergency Response

Emergency features MUST work reliably on unstable South African mobile networks. All panic response, incident reporting, and real-time communication features must be designed for mobile-first usage with offline capabilities, progressive web app features, and graceful degradation for poor network conditions.

## Development Standards

### Technology Stack Requirements

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 with Composition API and TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 + DaisyUI 5 only
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7+ with HMR
- **State Management**: Pinia with persisted state plugin
- **Internationalization**: Vue I18n with locale-aware routing
- **Mapping**: MapLibre GL for incident and vehicle tracking
- **Testing**: Vitest and Vue Test Utils

### Code Quality Standards

- All components must use `<script setup lang="ts">` syntax
- Props must be defined with TypeScript interfaces and `withDefaults`
- Emits must be declared with typed signatures
- Complex logic must be extracted into composables
- All async operations must include proper error handling with user-friendly notifications

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests required for all composables and utility functions
- Component tests required for all UI components
- Integration tests required for emergency response workflows
- All tests must pass before any feature can be considered complete
- Test coverage must be maintained above 80% for critical safety features

### Performance Standards

- Initial page load must complete within 3 seconds on 3G networks
- Emergency response features must respond within 1 second
- All interactive elements must meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- Mobile performance must be optimized for devices with limited resources

## Governance

All development work MUST comply with this constitution. Any proposed changes to these principles require:

1. Documentation of the specific need and impact
2. Approval from the project maintainers
3. Migration plan for existing features
4. Updated documentation and testing requirements
