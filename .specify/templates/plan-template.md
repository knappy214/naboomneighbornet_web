# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

### Community-First Development

- [ ] Feature prioritizes community safety and South African user accessibility
- [ ] Emergency response capabilities are enhanced or maintained
- [ ] User accessibility across diverse communities is considered

### Vue 3 + DaisyUI Consistency

- [ ] Uses Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript
- [ ] Follows Tailwind CSS 4 and DaisyUI 5 component patterns and semantic naming
- [ ] Maintains Light/Business theme consistency
- [ ] No custom CSS frameworks or alternative component libraries

### HTTP3 Optimization

- [ ] API calls designed for HTTP3 QUIC protocol
- [ ] Real-time features optimized for South African networks
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms for unstable network conditions

### Multilingual Support

- [ ] Full English and Afrikaans localization planned
- [ ] Vue I18n integration from day one
- [ ] All user-facing text localized

### Mobile-First Emergency Response

- [ ] Mobile-first design approach
- [ ] Offline capabilities where applicable
- [ ] Progressive Web App features considered
- [ ] Graceful degradation for poor network conditions

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
