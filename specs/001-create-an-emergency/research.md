# Research: Emergency Response System

**Feature**: Emergency Response System  
**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Phase**: 0 - Outline & Research

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. GPS Location Capture on Mobile Web

**Task**: Research GPS location capture for emergency alerts in mobile web browsers

**Decision**: Use Geolocation API with fallback to last known location

**Rationale**:

- Modern browsers support Geolocation API with good accuracy (10-100m)
- Fallback to last known location ensures alerts are never lost
- Progressive enhancement approach works across all device types

**Alternatives considered**:

- IP-based geolocation (rejected: too inaccurate for emergency response)
- Third-party location services (rejected: adds complexity and privacy concerns)
- Native app location APIs (rejected: web-only solution required)

**Implementation approach**:

- Primary: `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` with high accuracy settings
- Fallback: Cached location from previous successful capture
- Error handling: Manual location entry as last resort

### 2. Offline Message Queuing Strategy

**Task**: Research offline message queuing for emergency alerts

**Decision**: IndexedDB with service worker for background sync

**Rationale**:

- IndexedDB provides reliable local storage for complex data
- Service worker enables background sync when connectivity returns
- Works across all modern browsers and PWA environments

**Alternatives considered**:

- LocalStorage (rejected: limited storage capacity and synchronous API)
- WebSQL (rejected: deprecated and not widely supported)
- Server-side queuing only (rejected: doesn't work when completely offline)

**Implementation approach**:

- Store emergency alerts in IndexedDB with metadata (timestamp, retry count, priority)
- Service worker handles background sync with exponential backoff
- UI shows queued status and sync progress

### 3. Real-Time WebSocket Integration

**Task**: Research WebSocket integration for emergency alert distribution

**Decision**: Extend existing WebSocket infrastructure with emergency-specific channels

**Rationale**:

- Leverages existing WebSocket implementation in the codebase
- Maintains consistency with current real-time communication patterns
- Reduces complexity by reusing established connection management

**Alternatives considered**:

- Server-Sent Events (rejected: one-way communication insufficient)
- Polling (rejected: too slow for emergency response)
- New WebSocket implementation (rejected: unnecessary complexity)

**Implementation approach**:

- Add emergency alert channels to existing WebSocket service
- Implement emergency-specific message types and handlers
- Maintain connection health monitoring and reconnection logic

### 4. Push Notification Strategy

**Task**: Research push notifications for emergency alerts

**Decision**: Web Push API with service worker integration

**Rationale**:

- Native browser support for push notifications
- Works across all platforms and devices
- Integrates well with PWA architecture

**Alternatives considered**:

- SMS-only notifications (rejected: requires backend SMS service)
- Email notifications (rejected: too slow for emergency response)
- Third-party push services (rejected: adds external dependency)

**Implementation approach**:

- Request notification permission on first emergency alert setup
- Use Web Push API for real-time notifications
- Fallback to in-app notifications if permission denied

### 5. Mobile Performance Optimization

**Task**: Research mobile performance optimization for emergency features

**Decision**: Progressive Web App with service worker caching and optimized bundle

**Rationale**:

- PWA provides native app-like experience on mobile
- Service worker enables offline functionality and fast loading
- Optimized bundles reduce load time on slow networks

**Alternatives considered**:

- Native mobile apps (rejected: web-only solution required)
- Responsive web only (rejected: doesn't provide offline capability)
- Hybrid app frameworks (rejected: adds complexity and platform dependencies)

**Implementation approach**:

- Implement service worker for caching critical emergency resources
- Use Vite's code splitting for emergency-specific bundles
- Optimize images and assets for mobile networks
- Implement critical resource preloading

### 6. Accessibility for Emergency Features

**Task**: Research accessibility requirements for emergency response features

**Decision**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with emergency-specific enhancements

**Rationale**:

- WCAG 2.1 AA provides comprehensive accessibility standards
- Emergency features require higher accessibility standards due to critical nature
- Ensures usability for users with disabilities during emergencies

**Alternatives considered**:

- Basic accessibility (rejected: insufficient for emergency features)
- WCAG 2.1 AAA (rejected: may impact performance and complexity)
- Custom accessibility solution (rejected: reinventing established standards)

**Implementation approach**:

- High contrast mode for emergency buttons and alerts
- Screen reader announcements for emergency status changes
- Keyboard navigation for all emergency features
- Voice control integration where possible
- Large touch targets for panic button (minimum 44px)
