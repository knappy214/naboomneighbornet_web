# Implementation Plan: Emergency Response System

**Branch**: `001-create-an-emergency` | **Date**: 2024-12-19 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-create-an-emergency/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement a comprehensive emergency response system for the Naboom Community Platform that enables instant emergency alerts with GPS location capture, real-time distribution to emergency contacts and responders, multilingual support, and offline capability. The system will integrate with existing Vue 3 + DaisyUI architecture, HTTP3 backend infrastructure, and WebSocket real-time communication.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript, Node.js 20.19.0+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Vue 3, Tailwind CSS 4, DaisyUI 5, Pinia, Vue I18n, MapLibre GL, WebSocket API  
**Storage**: Local Storage for offline queuing, Backend API for persistence  
**Testing**: Vitest, Vue Test Utils, Playwright for E2E  
**Target Platform**: Progressive Web App (mobile-first), Web browsers with GPS support  
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend enhancement)  
**Performance Goals**: Emergency alerts transmitted within 3 seconds, 99.9% uptime, 1000+ concurrent alerts  
**Constraints**: <1 second response time for emergency features, offline capability for 24 hours, <2 second mobile load time  
**Scale/Scope**: 1000+ concurrent emergency alerts, 500+ emergency contacts, 100+ community responders

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

### Community-First Development

- [x] Feature prioritizes community safety and South African user accessibility
- [x] Emergency response capabilities are enhanced or maintained
- [x] User accessibility across diverse communities is considered

### Vue 3 + DaisyUI Consistency

- [x] Uses Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript
- [x] Follows Tailwind CSS 4 and DaisyUI 5 component patterns and semantic naming
- [x] Maintains Light/Business theme consistency
- [x] No custom CSS frameworks or alternative component libraries

### HTTP3 Optimization

- [x] API calls designed for HTTP3 QUIC protocol
- [x] Real-time features optimized for South African networks
- [x] Fallback mechanisms for unstable network conditions

### Multilingual Support

- [x] Full English and Afrikaans localization planned
- [x] Vue I18n integration from day one
- [x] All user-facing text localized

### Mobile-First Emergency Response

- [x] Mobile-first design approach
- [x] Offline capabilities where applicable
- [x] Progressive Web App features considered
- [x] Graceful degradation for poor network conditions

## Constitution Check - Post Design

**Status**: ✅ ALL GATES PASSED

### Design Validation

All constitution requirements have been validated through the design phase:

- **Community-First Development**: Emergency response system directly enhances community safety with GPS location capture, real-time alert distribution, and multilingual support for South African users
- **Vue 3 + DaisyUI Consistency**: All components designed using Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, and DaisyUI 5 semantic classes
- **HTTP3 Optimization**: API contracts designed for HTTP3 QUIC protocol with WebSocket real-time communication
- **Multilingual Support**: Complete English/Afrikaans localization planned with Vue I18n integration
- **Mobile-First Emergency Response**: PWA architecture with offline capabilities, service worker caching, and graceful degradation

### Technical Architecture Compliance

- **Data Model**: Aligns with existing Pinia store patterns and TypeScript interfaces
- **API Contracts**: RESTful design with HTTP3 optimization and WebSocket real-time updates
- **Component Structure**: Follows established Vue 3 + DaisyUI component organization
- **Performance Targets**: Meets constitution requirements for emergency response times
