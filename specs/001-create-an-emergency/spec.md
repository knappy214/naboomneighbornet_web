# Feature Specification: Emergency Response System

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-an-emergency`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create an emergency response system for Naboom Community Platform:"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - One-Tap Emergency Alert (Priority: P1)

A community member in distress can instantly trigger an emergency alert with a single tap, automatically capturing their GPS location and sending real-time notifications to emergency contacts and responders.

**Why this priority**: This is the core emergency functionality that saves lives. Without this, the system provides no emergency value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by tapping the panic button and verifying that an alert is sent within 3 seconds with accurate location data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is logged into the app, **When** they tap the emergency panic button, **Then** an emergency alert is sent within 3 seconds with their current GPS location
2. **Given** a user has poor network connectivity, **When** they tap the panic button, **Then** the alert is queued and sent as soon as connectivity is restored
3. **Given** a user's GPS is disabled, **When** they tap the panic button, **Then** the alert is sent with the last known location and a note about GPS accuracy

---

### User Story 2 - Real-Time Alert Distribution (Priority: P1)

Emergency alerts are instantly distributed to all relevant parties including emergency contacts, community responders, and security personnel via multiple channels.

**Why this priority**: Emergency response requires immediate notification of all stakeholders to ensure rapid assistance.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering an alert and verifying that all configured emergency contacts and responders receive notifications within 5 seconds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an emergency alert is triggered, **When** the system processes it, **Then** all active emergency contacts receive SMS and push notifications within 5 seconds
2. **Given** an emergency alert is triggered, **When** the system processes it, **Then** all active community responders in the same province receive notifications
3. **Given** a responder acknowledges an alert, **When** they update the status, **Then** the original reporter and other responders see the status update in real-time

---

### User Story 3 - Multilingual Emergency Interface (Priority: P2)

Emergency features are fully accessible in both English and Afrikaans, ensuring all South African community members can use the system effectively during emergencies.

**Why this priority**: Language barriers during emergencies can be life-threatening. This ensures accessibility for the entire target community.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by switching language settings and verifying all emergency UI elements display correctly in both languages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has their language set to Afrikaans, **When** they access emergency features, **Then** all buttons, messages, and instructions are displayed in Afrikaans
2. **Given** a user receives an emergency alert, **When** they view the alert details, **Then** the alert content is displayed in their preferred language
3. **Given** a user is in an emergency situation, **When** they interact with the system, **Then** all confirmation messages and status updates appear in their selected language

---

### User Story 4 - Offline Emergency Capability (Priority: P2)

The emergency system continues to function even when network connectivity is poor or temporarily unavailable, ensuring alerts are not lost.

**Why this priority**: South African rural areas often have unreliable network coverage, making offline capability critical for emergency situations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by disabling network connectivity, triggering an alert, and verifying it's queued and sent when connectivity returns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has no network connectivity, **When** they tap the panic button, **Then** the alert is stored locally and queued for transmission
2. **Given** a queued alert exists, **When** network connectivity is restored, **Then** the alert is automatically transmitted within 10 seconds
3. **Given** multiple alerts are queued offline, **When** connectivity returns, **Then** all alerts are transmitted in chronological order

---

### User Story 5 - Emergency Status Tracking (Priority: P3)

Users can track the status of their emergency alerts and see real-time updates from responders, providing reassurance during stressful situations.

**Why this priority**: Status visibility reduces anxiety and helps coordinate response efforts, though it's secondary to alert transmission.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering an alert and verifying that status updates from responders are displayed in real-time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has triggered an emergency alert, **When** a responder acknowledges it, **Then** the user sees the acknowledgment status update
2. **Given** a responder is en route, **When** they update their status, **Then** the user sees their estimated arrival time and location
3. **Given** an emergency is resolved, **When** the responder marks it complete, **Then** the user receives a confirmation and can provide feedback

### Edge Cases

- What happens when GPS location cannot be determined (last known location vs. manual entry)?
- How does the system handle multiple rapid panic button presses?
- What occurs when emergency contacts have invalid phone numbers?
- How does the system behave when WebSocket connections fail during alert transmission?
- What happens when the app is backgrounded during an emergency alert?
- How does the system handle battery optimization that might kill the app?
- What occurs when emergency responders are offline or unavailable?
