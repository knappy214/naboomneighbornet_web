# Feature Specification: Community Communication Hub

**Feature Branch**: `002-create-community-communication`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a community communication hub with real-time messaging, event management, and multilingual support for South African neighborhoods"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Real-Time Neighborhood Messaging (Priority: P1)

Community members can send and receive instant messages in organized discussion channels to share information, coordinate activities, and build neighborhood connections.

**Why this priority**: Real-time messaging is the core communication functionality that enables immediate information sharing and community coordination, which is essential for neighborhood safety and engagement.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by joining a neighborhood channel, sending a message, and verifying that all online members receive the message instantly with proper sender identification and timestamp.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a community member is logged into the platform, **When** they select a neighborhood discussion channel, **Then** they can see recent messages and send new messages in real-time
2. **Given** a member is typing a message, **When** other members are viewing the same channel, **Then** they see a typing indicator showing who is currently composing
3. **Given** a member sends a message, **When** other members are online, **Then** they receive the message instantly with sender name and timestamp

### User Story 2 - Multilingual Community Access (Priority: P1)

All communication features are available in both English and Afrikaans, ensuring South African community members can participate effectively regardless of their preferred language.

**Why this priority**: Language accessibility is critical for community inclusion in South Africa, where both English and Afrikaans are widely spoken. Without this, a significant portion of the community cannot participate effectively.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by switching the interface language and verifying that all messaging features, notifications, and user interface elements display correctly in the selected language.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has their language preference set to Afrikaans, **When** they access any communication feature, **Then** all interface elements, buttons, and messages are displayed in Afrikaans
2. **Given** a user receives a notification, **When** they view the notification, **Then** the content appears in their selected language
3. **Given** a user is composing a message, **When** they use the interface, **Then** all help text, placeholders, and validation messages appear in their preferred language

---

### User Story 3 - Community Event Coordination (Priority: P2)

Community members can create, manage, and participate in neighborhood events with real-time updates, RSVP tracking, and event-specific discussion threads.

**Why this priority**: Event coordination enables community building and allows members to organize activities, meetings, and social gatherings that strengthen neighborhood bonds and safety.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a neighborhood event, inviting community members, and verifying that participants receive notifications and can RSVP with comments.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a community member wants to organize a neighborhood event, **When** they create an event with details and invite others, **Then** invited members receive notifications and can view event details
2. **Given** an event has been created, **When** community members view the event, **Then** they can RSVP with comments and see who else is attending
3. **Given** an event is approaching, **When** the event date is near, **Then** all participants receive reminder notifications

---

### User Story 4 - User Profiles and Community Roles (Priority: P2)

Community members have detailed profiles showing their role, activity history, and contact information to provide context for communication and enable appropriate community organization.

**Why this priority**: User profiles provide essential context for communication and enable role-based community organization, helping members understand who they're communicating with and their responsibilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing a user's profile from a message, checking their role and activity, and verifying that profile information appears correctly in communication contexts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a community member is viewing a message, **When** they click on the sender's name, **Then** they can see the sender's profile with role, activity history, and contact information
2. **Given** a member has a specific community role, **When** they access communication features, **Then** they see appropriate permissions and capabilities based on their role
3. **Given** a member wants to update their profile, **When** they access their profile settings, **Then** they can modify their information, preferences, and notification settings

---

### User Story 5 - Offline Message Access (Priority: P3)

The communication system maintains functionality during network outages by queuing messages locally and synchronizing them when connectivity is restored, ensuring no communication is lost.

**Why this priority**: South African rural and urban areas often have unreliable network coverage, making offline capability essential for maintaining community communication continuity.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by disabling network connectivity, composing messages, and verifying they are queued and automatically sent when connectivity returns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a community member has no network connectivity, **When** they compose and send a message, **Then** the message is stored locally and marked as pending delivery
2. **Given** a member has pending messages, **When** network connectivity is restored, **Then** all pending messages are automatically sent within 10 seconds
3. **Given** a member is offline, **When** they receive messages, **Then** the messages are queued and displayed when they come back online

---

### User Story 6 - Message Search and Discovery (Priority: P3)

Community members can search through message history, filter by channels, users, and time periods to find relevant information and maintain context across ongoing conversations.

**Why this priority**: Search functionality helps community members find important information, reference past discussions, and maintain context across ongoing neighborhood conversations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by searching for specific terms, applying filters, and verifying that search results are accurate and lead to the correct message locations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a community member wants to find a specific message, **When** they use the search function, **Then** they can search across all channels and find relevant messages with highlighting
2. **Given** a member is searching for messages, **When** they apply filters, **Then** they can narrow results by channel, user, date range, and message type
3. **Given** a member finds a relevant message, **When** they click on it, **Then** they are taken to the exact location in the conversation thread
