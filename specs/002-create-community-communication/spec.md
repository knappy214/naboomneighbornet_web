# Feature Specification: Community Communication Hub

**Feature Branch**: `002-create-community-communication`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create community communication hub for Naboom Platform:"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Real-Time Discussion Channels (Priority: P1)

Community members can participate in organized discussion channels (General, Safety, Events) with real-time messaging, typing indicators, and presence awareness to foster active community engagement.

**Why this priority**: This is the core communication functionality that enables community members to connect, share information, and build relationships in real-time.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by joining a channel, sending messages, and verifying that all participants see messages instantly with proper typing indicators and presence status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is authenticated and viewing the channels page, **When** they select a discussion channel, **Then** they can see the channel's message history and participate in real-time conversations
2. **Given** a user is typing in a channel, **When** other users are viewing the same channel, **Then** they see a typing indicator showing who is currently typing
3. **Given** multiple users are active in a channel, **When** they view the channel, **Then** they can see which users are currently online and their presence status

### User Story 2 - Multilingual Community Interface (Priority: P1)

All communication features are fully accessible in both English and Afrikaans, ensuring South African community members can participate effectively regardless of their language preference.

**Why this priority**: Language accessibility is critical for community engagement in South Africa, where both English and Afrikaans are widely spoken.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by switching language settings and verifying all communication UI elements, messages, and notifications display correctly in both languages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has their language set to Afrikaans, **When** they access any communication feature, **Then** all interface elements, buttons, and labels are displayed in Afrikaans
2. **Given** a user receives a notification, **When** they view the notification, **Then** the content is displayed in their preferred language
3. **Given** a user is composing a message, **When** they use the interface, **Then** all placeholder text, validation messages, and help text appear in their selected language

---

### User Story 3 - Event Management and Coordination (Priority: P2)

Community members can create, manage, and coordinate events through the communication hub, with real-time updates and discussion threads for each event.

**Why this priority**: Event coordination is essential for community building and allows members to organize activities, meetings, and social gatherings effectively.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating an event, inviting community members, and verifying that all participants receive notifications and can participate in event discussions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to create a community event, **When** they access the events section, **Then** they can create an event with details, date, location, and invite community members
2. **Given** an event has been created, **When** community members are invited, **Then** they receive notifications and can RSVP with comments
3. **Given** an event is approaching, **When** the event date is near, **Then** all participants receive reminder notifications

---

### User Story 4 - User Profile and Role Management (Priority: P2)

Community members have detailed profiles with roles, permissions, and activity history that enhance communication context and community organization.

**Why this priority**: User profiles provide context for communication and enable role-based permissions that help organize community activities and responsibilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing user profiles, checking role-based permissions, and verifying that profile information appears correctly in communication contexts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is viewing a message, **When** they click on the sender's name, **Then** they can see the sender's profile with role, activity history, and contact information
2. **Given** a user has a specific community role, **When** they access communication features, **Then** they see appropriate permissions and capabilities based on their role
3. **Given** a user wants to update their profile, **When** they access their profile settings, **Then** they can modify their information, preferences, and notification settings

---

### User Story 5 - Offline Message Queuing (Priority: P3)

The communication system continues to function during network outages by queuing messages locally and synchronizing them when connectivity is restored.

**Why this priority**: South African rural areas often have unreliable network coverage, making offline capability essential for maintaining community communication.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by disabling network connectivity, composing messages, and verifying they are queued and sent when connectivity returns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has no network connectivity, **When** they compose and send a message, **Then** the message is stored locally and marked as pending
2. **Given** a user has pending messages, **When** network connectivity is restored, **Then** all pending messages are automatically sent within 10 seconds
3. **Given** a user is offline, **When** they receive messages, **Then** the messages are queued and displayed when they come back online

---

### User Story 6 - Message Search and Discovery (Priority: P3)

Community members can search through message history, filter by channels, users, and time periods to find relevant information and conversations.

**Why this priority**: Search functionality helps community members find important information and maintain context across ongoing conversations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by searching for specific terms, filtering by various criteria, and verifying that search results are accurate and relevant.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to find a specific message, **When** they use the search function, **Then** they can search across all channels and find relevant messages with highlighting
2. **Given** a user is searching for messages, **When** they apply filters, **Then** they can narrow results by channel, user, date range, and message type
3. **Given** a user finds a relevant message, **When** they click on it, **Then** they are taken to the exact location in the conversation thread

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user sends a message while their authentication token expires?
- How does the system handle rapid message sending or spam prevention?
- What occurs when a channel is deleted while users are actively participating?
- How does the system behave when WebSocket connections fail during message transmission?
- What happens when a user's role changes while they are actively using the system?
- How does the system handle very long messages or message attachments?
- What occurs when multiple users try to edit the same event simultaneously?
